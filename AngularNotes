Basic->
1- Use TypeScript -> a Super Set to javaScript
 Ts cannot run on the browser and we can convert it into javaScript at the end.
 JavaScript runs on the browser.

Install npm globally ->
npm install -g @angular/cli

Folder structure and How angular Works->

karma.conf -> used to Test Angular application.
package.json -> All the dependencies by the project.
tsconfig.json -> TypeScript Compiler.
node-modules -> all the dependencies those were downloaded by Npm.
Environments -> where we manage diff Environment Variables.
index.html and main.ts and app-> very imp files

---> How Anagular app Starts?
index.html -> single page that you see on the UI.
1-first it will see the index.html and kick start main.ts
2-bootstart the AppModule from main.ts.
3-from AppModule it will bootstrap appcomponent.


Components :->
Are the key building blcoks of Any angular Application.
Angular Components we write what we are planing to show and angular do the
heavy liftign work . One of the js bundel containing sc to show components and
that is doing the work.

@component-> Dacorator -> used to add additional information to classes or directive
selector , templateUrl , styleurl
-------------------------------------------------

bindinf ralated notes ->

[value] = "name" and value = "{{name}}"
First one we are setting the input element value object to some value . 2nd case
input element value attribute to some text.

[(ngmodel)] -> can be used on an element which is having value attribute.
If the value changed from Ui Side , then it will bind it in TS and vice versha.
Thats why called as two way binding.

directive -> Are the instructions you place on your template.
it allows you to adjust the parts of the elements it sits on.

It will be nice if we can listen to our custom events.

@input -> Sending data from parent component to child component.
From the parent Html file we can send the data.
@input() -> is a dacorator ->in Angular dacorator can be assigned to not only class,
but other things as well.

<app-user [name]="name" [location]="'Sambalpur'" (nameChange)="onNameChanged($event)">

[] -> binding varibale in usercompnent.ts , () means listening to events coming from
UserComponent.ts .

property binding and event binding both makes the component communicate withe each other.
------------------------->
cli to create a component-> ng g c user-detail

----------------------------------->
Angular code debugging:-
Normal Chrome debugger will work.
----------------------------------->
To add bootstrap to our application :->
npm install bootstrap --save   - and this --save

will create an entry in package.json
so that we can see the dependencies.
import 'lodash' is the command to import a node_module to TS file.
---------------------------------------------------
declare var _: any;
npm install --save @types/lodash
--------------------------------------
ng class is a non-structural directive. *ngFor is a structural directive.

--------------------------------------------------
Browser events y default bubble up to the parent where as custom events angular do for it.
-----------------------
backend services changes we bring to parent component and from there we ll pass it to child components.


---------------------------------------------

Template quering with view child and view children.
In the parent when we want to access the child component or child component elements,
then we can go for viewChild.

for multiple , we can go for view children.

viewChild and viewChildren dacorator can be passed with either component name or
template ref or part of the template ref.

Sometimes we queried for complete elemet , but we dont need the Component , but we need
the Html element.

Todo task -> 1 - check whether you can get template ref in the same component or not?

both are local quering mechanism . It cannot query to child component or parent component.
--------------------------------------
Whenever you are setting color or doing something with renderer2 , from elementRef take
the native element.

------------------------------------------------------

CONTENT PROJECTION IN ANGULAR:-

-> content projection is all about making your UI configurable.

ContentChild and viewChild in a nutshell:-

viewchild can query the child component and rest all template within the component
Contentchild can query the child component projected inside the component and rest all
Template inside the projected content.

@contentChild is used when the component is using Content projection and somehow we ned to
grab hold of the component ref or template ref of the projected content.

---------------------------
NgTemplate -> It will not be a part of the dom unless we explicitely call it.

Can use the variables that is a part of the component on which <ng-template> resides.

NgTemplateOutlet : -> Used to instantiate a ng-template.

-----------------------------------
Angular Directives :-
1- structure Directive and attribute Directives
