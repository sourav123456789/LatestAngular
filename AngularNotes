Basic->
1- Use TypeScript -> a Super Set to javaScript
 Ts cannot run on the browser and we can convert it into javaScript at the end.
 JavaScript runs on the browser.

Install npm globally ->
npm install -g @angular/cli

Folder structure and How angular Works->

karma.conf -> used to Test Angular application.
package.json -> All the dependencies by the project.
tsconfig.json -> TypeScript Compiler.
node-modules -> all the dependencies those were downloaded by Npm.
Environments -> where we manage diff Environment Variables.
index.html and main.ts and app-> very imp files

---> How Anagular app Starts?
index.html -> single page that you see on the UI.
1-first it will see the index.html and kick start main.ts
2-bootstart the AppModule from main.ts.
3-from AppModule it will bootstrap appcomponent.


Components :->
Are the key building blcoks of Any angular Application.
Angular Components we write what we are planing to show and angular do the 
heavy liftign work . One of the js bundel containing sc to show components and
that is doing the work.

@component-> Dacorator -> used to add additional information to classes or directive
selector , templateUrl , styleurl
-------------------------------------------------

bindinf ralated notes ->

[value] = "name" and value = "{{name}}"
First one we are setting the input element value object to some value . 2nd case 
input element value attribute to some text.

[(ngmodel)] -> can be used on an element which is having value attribute.
If the value changed from Ui Side , then it will bind it in TS and vice versha.
Thats why called as two way binding.

directive -> Are the instructions you place on your template.
it allows you to adjust the parts of the elements it sits on.
